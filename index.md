# Tetris FAQ

## How to ask a good question

1. Read the FAQ
2. Think about your question before you ask.
   1. Understand that **you do not deserve to have your question answered**. People are taking time out of their day to **help** you. 
   2. Try and phrase your question in a way that makes it easier for the person answering.
      1. Try and be as specific as you can. (This does not mean write a wall of text for no reason)
      2. Actually think about what you are trying to ask.
   3. Try and figure it out yourself first, before you ask. (It's easier to confirm something is right than to explain it from scratch)
      1. If it's gameplay related, try recording and watching yourself.

## I'm a new player, where should I start.

If you are brand new, start by playing a game with **marathon mode**, just try your best to survive.

Once you are familiar with the game and its controls, try and complete a 40 line sprint only using tetrises.  (make sure to rotate in both directions)

Once you can complete a tetris-only sprints consistently, try and lower your tetris-only sprint to around 2-1:30 - 2:00 minutes. 

Once you've done that, you're now ready to play versus. 

Hop into a versus game and good luck!



## Openers

## **<u>Sprint</u>** openers/ how to stack.

You should not rely on <u>**sprint**</u> openers. You should be able to sprint from any starter bag (exception being ZSO openers)

You should be able to figure out your own "<u>**sprint**</u> openers" by playing the game and watching people better than you play. 

(Note: Do not use <u>**versus**</u> openers in sprint)

(Note: <u>**sprint**</u> openers are different from <u>**versus**</u> openers).

## What controls should I use

Use what ever is comfortable :) 

There is no "best controls"



## What das/arr should I use

In games where you can customize arr and das, arr should be as low as possible (0 or 1). 

To pick a das start around 130ms / 8F (some games use frames which are 16.66 ms) and then keep lowering it until you cannot control it.  

Your das should be probably be below 130 ms unless you have some sort of physical impairment. 

## Sprint time

Here are some rough guidelines to sprint

|              | No delay (Jstris, TETR.IO) | Slow (Puyo Puyo Tetris) |
| ------------ | -------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Pro          | 20 sec                     | 35 sec                  |
| Experienced  | 25 sec                     | 38 sec                  |
| Intermediate | 30 sec                     | 47 sec                  |
| "decent"     | 44 sec                     | 60 sec                  |
| beginner     | 80 sec /1:20 min           | 2:00 min                |
| new          | 3 min+/ DNF                | 3 min+/DNF              |

## How to get faster (sprint)

Proper practice is key to improvement. Don't feel discouraged when you see people improving faster than you, you have to keep in mind the key factors to improvement. 

1. Time
   1. If you don't actually spend the time to play the game, and review your own gameplay, you will not be able to improve.
2. Efficiency of practice
   1. Some ways of practicing make better use of your time than others. For example, someone who restarts very frequently will get less practice per hour than someone who doesn't. 

Keep in mind that there is a difference between getting a new **personal best** and **improving**. 

## How to get better

## 6-3 vs 9-0 vs 0-9 vs freestyle stacking for sprint

## Finesse. (What should my finesse be, should I learn finesse, etc)

## SRS stuff 

## Tspin stuff
