## How to ask a good question

1. Read the FAQ first
2. Try to think about your question before you ask it.
   1. Understand that people are taking time out of **their day** to **help you**. 
   2. Try and phrase your question in a way that makes it **easier for the person answering**.
      1. Try and **be as specific** as you can. (This does not mean write as much as you can).
      2. **Be clear**. It only slows down the process if people have to repeatedly ask for more detail or clarification. You don't want to waste the time of people trying to help you
      3. **Think** about what you are trying to ask for a bit, that way you can formulate a better question.
   3. Try and figure it out yourself, before asking.
      1. The best way to learn something is figuring it out yourself.
      2. It's easier to confirm something is right than to explain it from scratch.
      3. If it's gameplay related, try recording and watching yourself. 
      4. check FAQ

## How to answer questions

1. The goal here is to **minimize misinformation**
   1. Make sure you **know** what you are **qualified** to talk about.
   2. Make sure you are **able to explain** **what** you are saying and **why**, otherwise you might not have a complete understanding of it. 
   3. Know what you *don't know*, if you don't know what you don't know, you're more likely to mislead people.
   4. Think before you answer, if you don't know the answer, don't say anything. It's ok to be wrong, but not to mislead others. 



## I'm a new player, where should I start?

If you are new to the game, play **marathon mode**, just try your best to survive. Tetris.com will work for this.

Once you are familiar with the game and its controls, try and complete a 40 line sprint using only Tetrises.  Make sure to use both clockwise and counter-clockwise.

Once you can complete Tetris-only sprints consistently, try and lower your Tetris-only sprint to around 1:30 - 2:00 minutes. 

Once you've done that, you're now ready to play versus. 

Hop into a versus game and good luck!



## Where do I find people to play against? 

If your game has native matchmaking support, like tetr.io or puyo puyo tetris, you can use the matchmaking feature. Otherwise join the [Matchmaking Central (MMC)](https://discord.gg/yvUQwhq) discord, which has matchmaking based on skill level.

## How do I get faster?

Proper practice is key to improvement. **Don't feel discouraged** when you see people improving faster than you, you have to keep in mind the key factors to improvement:

1. Time
   - If you don't actually spend the time to play the game, and review your own gameplay, you will not be able to improve.
2. Efficiency of practice
   - Some ways of practicing make better use of your time than others. For example, someone who restarts sprint very frequently will get less practice per hour than someone who doesn't. 

Keep in mind that there also is a difference between getting a new **personal best** and  **actually improving**. 

## How to stack

The best way to learn how to stack is to play a lot, and to review your own gameplay and the gameplay of people much better than you. 

Experiment and try new things, and try to notice patterns. 

You should have an intuitive understanding of how to stack, most specific guides and tutorials won't help, as it will limit your growth if you try to just "memorize" a list of setups. 

As a general rule of thumb: 

1. Do not make piece dependencies.
2. Plan ahead and make use of your piece previews.

## What controls should I use?

Use what ever is comfortable :) 

There is no "best controls"

Some common layouts are:

| Default Tetris Friends          | ![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/574712820994670594/722598713654247434/ArisaIchigaya-keys.png) |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Split Rotate and move**       | ![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/574712820994670594/722084902568198224/brian-keys.png) |
| **Controller style (reversed)** | ![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/574712820994670594/722106363253358626/MdestTomato-keys.png) |



## What das/arr should I use?

In games where you can customize arr and das, arr should be as low as possible (0 or 1). 

To pick a das start around 130ms / 8F (some games use frames which are 16.66 ms) and then keep lowering it until you cannot control it.  

Most players will be able to use a das below 130 ms. While it is possible to play at the top level with higher settings, you should not unless you absolutely have to.

## What is finesse? Should I learn finesse?

Finesse is the method of placing a specific piece in a specific location with predetermined set of key inputs. 

There is a specific optimal sequence of inputs for every single placement in the game, this called perfect finesse / 2 step finesse.

People often mean "**Perfect Finesse**" or "2 step finesse", when they refer to finesse. 

Lots of top players do not have "perfect finesse" but will still have a set way of placing pieces. 

Whether you decide you want to use the most optimal set of sequences is up to you. (You should use both rotations though.)

## Should I learn 180 rotations?

If you want to. 

Learning to rotate clockwise and counter-clockwise is most important. 180 is extra if you want to, they don't exist in official games, however. 

Some top players don't use 180, it doesn't make that big of a difference. 

## How many previews do I need to use?

In general you should use as many previews as the game allows you to use. Whether you're just checking previews for an upcoming piece or actually planning out all 5 pieces ahead of time. Most good players use all previews.

## How do I use piece previews effectively? Dependencies?  

To leverage piece previews effectively, you want to plan out your current placement in a way that accommodates your next pieces and avoids creating dependencies.

Consider this field, with your current piece being an L. ![](https://i.imgur.com/pUNEyM7.png)

If your next piece is a Z, T, L you would probably place it like this ![](https://i.imgur.com/l4dRyP1.png)

If your next piece is a J or I, you would probably place it like ![](https://i.imgur.com/6bwhytv.png)

If your next pieces are S or O it depends on the rest of your field. 

## How to hold effectively? 

Hold is used effectively in the following scenarios:

- Saving an I or a T piece 
- When you cannot place your current piece in a good spot
- When you require your held piece before your current piece
- Stalling

The biggest mistake people use hold for is to switch/shuffle the order of pieces, when the same placements are possible without holding.

## Where do I look on the screen?

Depends on what is most comfortable to you. Some people prefer to use their peripheral vision to look at the queue/piece preview, others will dart their eyes back and fourth. See what works best for you, and try resizing the game window if that helps.

## How to practice using... (both rotates, all previews, finesse, etc)?

Most of these "how do I practice doing x" or "how to practice using x" questions just come down to being disciplined.  To practice using all previews, slow down and look at them. To practice using both rotates, slow down and rotate both ways. There's not really any secret to it. 

## How to practice?

1. Play a lot 
2. Review your own replays and replays of people better than you
3. If you get stuck see FAQ or try and ask a good question or buy coaching from me for 30$/hr

## Should I learn how to ST stack? 

No. "Repeatable stacking patterns" are bad to rely on. 

If you insist on learning a pattern, learn the modern [LST stacking.](https://four.lol/stacking/lst)

Infinite stacking patterns like, ST, LST, infinite TST, are usually only good for the "Ultra" game mode. You will rarely have the opportunity to use them in versus.

## How do I get better at Perfect Clears? Mid game PC?

[Here's some tips by some of the best people at PCs, JimothyJimothy and Cosin307](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uhmsx4tPTQChV87JGa9nKma7CU4bSRgeEtctkxACeAE/edit)

As for mid game pcs, they are really rare and mostly luck, there is no way to get more lucky. 

## What is Parity? How do I learn Parity?

**TLDR**: Parity is a nerd trap. The use of parity in Tetris aims to solve the problem of "stacking" without holes. In reality just thinking about parity will not give you a conclusive answer as to whether a stack is good or not (ie. whether it is maintainable or has severe dependencies on certain pieces). It is still necessary to think about the dependencies themselves, thus making parity extra work for no reason. **Most good players can already evaluate stacks intuitively, and can visualize piece dependencies through practice.** 

### Explanation:

Parity is the mathematical concept of even/oddness. If you imagine a checkerboard pattern, you can see the "parity" of each piece by looking at the number of black and white squares it would occupy. ![](https://i.imgur.com/YKusYen.png) 

So using this we can discover that all the pieces have even parity, except for the T piece, which has odd parity (3:1 ratio).

 ![](https://i.imgur.com/Ez93rfD.png)

So the only way to change the "parity" of a field in Tetris is either to use a T piece or to clear an odd number of lines. If you really can't help yourself but read more here is an article https://harddrop.com/wiki/Parity

### Conclusion

Something about row parity ??

## Does this setup have a name? Is this setup worth naming?

Most useful/practical setups have already been discovered. It is common for newer players to want to "invent" something to "become a part of Tetris history", but first you have to evaluate whether you setup is even worth looking at.

A good setup is usually has the following qualities:

1. It is a flexible shape/setup leading to it. Example of bad:

    ![](https://i.imgur.com/m0iaZmW.png)

2. It is not a large commitment. An example of bad: 

![](https://i.imgur.com/aGaXGgc.png)

There are 2^20 possible board states in Tetris (2^40 if you include the hidden rows), most of them are not worth naming. 

# Sprint specific advice

## What is a good sprint time? Is my sprint time good?

"Good" is subjective but here are some general guidelines:

|              | No delay (Jstris, TETR.IO) | Slow (Puyo Puyo Tetris) |
| ------------ | -------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Pro          | 20 sec                     | 35 sec                  |
| Experienced  | 25 sec                     | 38 sec                  |
| Intermediate | 30 sec                     | 47 sec                  |
| "decent"     | 44 sec                     | 60 sec                  |
| beginner     | 80 sec /1:20 min           | 2:00 min                |
| new          | 3 min+/ DNF                | 3 min+/DNF              |

## **<u>Sprint</u>** openers

You should not rely on <u>**sprint**</u> openers. You should be able to sprint from any starting bag (exception being "SZ" openers)

You should be able to figure out your own "<u>**sprint**</u> openers" by playing the game and watching people better than you play. Do not rely on sprint openers as it will impact your rate of improvement.

(Note: Do not use <u>**versus**</u> openers in sprint)

(Note: <u>**sprint**</u> openers are different from <u>**versus**</u> openers).

## What is good finesse/what should my finesse be in sprint

The finesse value in most games are finesse *faults*. 

If you care about finesse aim for 0, otherwise it doesn't really matter, try and keep it under 15~.

## 6-3 vs 9-0 vs 0-9 vs freestyle stacking for sprint

```
6-3
|xxxxxx xxx|
|xxxxxx xxx|
|xxxxxx xxx|
|xxxxxx xxx|

9-0 (right well)
|xxxxxxxxx |
|xxxxxxxxx |
|xxxxxxxxx |
|xxxxxxxxx |

0-9 (left well)
| xxxxxxxxx|
| xxxxxxxxx|
| xxxxxxxxx|
| xxxxxxxxx|

freestyle (some people call it korean stacking, no well) 
|          |
|          |
|          |
|x xxx   xx|
```

| Style     | Pros                                             | Cons                                                         |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 6-3       | More opportunities for better KPP                | More difficult to maintain                                   |
| 9-0       | Easier to maintain                               | Requires much more thinking to get low KPP                   |
| 0-9       | Don't use this                                   | Has higher KPP than right well (9-0)                         |
| freestyle | Allows for the lowest KPP and most possibilities | Hardest style of stacking to be fast at by far. Clearing lines requires much more mental processing power. Really bad on games with line clear delay |

Any other style of stacking,3-6, 5-4, 7-2, 8-1 etc are bad and don't matter. 

## How do I lower KPP? What KPP should I aim for? (Sprint)

Perfect finesse is basically a requirement of low KPP.

A good KPP to aim for in sprint is 3.0 KPP. The best players can get under 2.6 KPP.

Some things that can help lower KPP:

- Hold less. 
- 6-3 stacking can make it easier to get lower KPP. (Note: that this does not mean 6-3 is the *best* way to get low KPP)
- Learn about advanced techniques like das preservation, rotating less, and think A LOT.

Like stacking there isn't a definitive way of getting good, just practice and be analytical.

# Versus specific advice

## Openers

Learning openers is not as important as learning how to play the mid game. 

An opener is just a transition from an empty board to mid game, don't focus on them too much until you are competent at mid game. You should never rely on openers to win games.

Beginners can opt for a simple tetris as their opener. 

Openers are also dependent on the game. 

The most important opener to learn is TKI. https://four.lol/openers/tki

## What openers should I learn?

**If you are unable complete a 40 line Tetris-only sprint in under 1:15 minutes (jstris/fast games) or 1:30 minutes Puyo Puyo Tetris (slow game) should focus on practicing that first.**

Here is a list of openers by importance (four wide is omitted in this section, to learn [more read the section on four wide](##four-wide-4-wide-4w-4-w-c4w-s4w-whatever-lol)) : 

| Opener                                                       | Why                                                          |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| [TKI 3](https://four.lol/openers/tki)                        | - Hands down the best overall opener in the game.<br />- Most flexible opener (Lots of TSD opportunities, TSD PC, TSD TSD PC, LST stacking). <br />- Keeps the stack low at all times, basically risk free. <br />- Basically can always do it with an early I piece. <br />- Easy to learn the basics, but has a lot of depth.<br />- Good in any game. |
| [MKO](https://four.lol/openers/mko/)                         | - Not as popular as many of the newer "memorization openers" but still really good.<br />- Very flexible opener (can choose to do fast PC, TSDs, converts into 6-3 as well)<br />- Ends up with more of a stack than TKI<br />- Works when you have early LJ. <br />- Easy to learn basics, but has a lot of depth.<br />- Good in any game. |
| [Hachi-spin](https://four.lol/openers/hachispin)             | - Hachi good.<br />- Fairly flexible (TSS TST PC, TSS TST LST stacking, TSS TST imperial cross)<br />- Ends up with a good stack<br />- only requires early OL or OJ<br />- Easy to learn basics, but has several follow ups.<br />- Good in PPT and other official games, decent in jstris, not that great for tetr.io |
| [Albatross](https://four.lol/openers/albatross)              | - A more popular opener in recent times.<br />- Not very flexible, but fairly consistent (simple TSD TST TSD, or potential TSD PC)<br />- You'll basically always have a relatively low stack <br />- Needs early OL or OJ<br />- Easy to learn, not much depth, most people end up just mechanically memorizing it.<br />- Good in PPT and other official games, decent in jstris, not that great for tetr.io |
| [Mr. T-spin](https://four.lol/openers/mr-tspin)              | - Not that popular but really good still ok guys plz use it instead of pco<br />- Not really any set follow ups, freestyle after TST.<br />- Stack is pretty low and good, except for weird looking L/J used for overhang<br />- Needs early OZ or OS<br />- Has a weird shape that might be easy to forget, but overall it is not that complicated<br />- Good in PPT and other official games, decent in jstris, not that great for tetr.io |
| [Pelican](http://fumen.zui.jp/?v115@ChhlBewhQ4BtCeglRpwhR4BtAeg0glRpwhAeQ4Cei0?AewhJeAgWHAiSZTASomAAKhywHewwYeAgH1gBtDeglDeBtC?eglAeh0AezhQ4hlg0BeRph0S4g0whAeRpilR4JeAgWHAiSZ?TAS4oAAygwhBeBPDeglwhAeR4BPRpAtglyhAeQawwhlwSQp?QaAPhlwSQpBehWAeAPBeRpCegWKeAgHvgwhBeQaDehlwhAe?APQaAexDBeQagWBeQaBPh0gHQagWQpQaQpxhAtAegHBehlA?egWAeg0hHCeglKeAgHvgQaCehlBehWQaCewhglCewhglCeg?WQahHg0whglCegWwSgHAeg0EewhAegHh0OeAgHvhAAgH) | - Pretty unpopular opener as well but still pretty good<br />- Follow ups do exist. (TSD TST C-SPIN PC, TSD STSD, TSD TST TSD)<br />- Stack is ok<br />- Needs early JS or LZ<br />- Good in PPT and other official games, decent in jstris, not that great for tetr.io |
| [DT cannon (Horizontal SZ base*)](https://four.lol/methods/dt-cannon) | - Super popular, a little overrated. **DO NOT USE VERTICAL DT or any other base**<br />- Follow ups are decent (DTS4W, DT C-Spin, DT Kaidan PC, DT shachiku train... etc)<br />- Stack is actually not that great (before the follow ups, which means you have to commit)<br />- Needs early L and J <br />- Good in PPT because it has low KPP to set up, using vertical dt or any other base nullifies this benefit. Ok on on faster games like jstris etc, but wouldn't recommend really. |
| [C-Spin](https://four.lol/methods/triple-double#opening-c-spin) | - Vintage opener, not really used by new players anymore<br />- Kind of tricky to stack honestly, has some follow ups (TST TSD or TST TSS PC)<br />- Leaves you with clean and low field. <br />- Needs early LZ or JS and helps to have early I for the popular method. There are other bases as well that work on different bags.<br />- Ok in all games |
| 6-3 stacking                                                 | - Honestly it's pretty good lol<br />- It's just stacking, basically as flexible as it gets. <br />- You lose on a bit of efficiency due to not being able to send anything in the first bag however. <br />Doesn't really depend on anything. <br />- Is ok in all games. |
| <u>**BAD OPENERS**</u>                                       | <u>**Anything below this point is bad do not learn unless you want to I'm just text on your computer monitor**</u> |
| BT Cannon                                                    | - Common "memorization opener"<br />- You will never be able to get the PC loop against a player with fingers<br />- Big noob trap, people often just memorize BT and try and win with the opener. If you're opponent is even close to equal skill you will lose. <br />- If you want to use a crutch pick c4w |
| Humming bird                                                 | - Lol<br />- If you're gonna learn an opener, learn one that sends garbage |
| PCO                                                          | - Read the section on ["Should I learn perfect clear opener?"](#pco-perfect-clear-opener-should-i-learn-perfect-clears)<br />- If you are reading this, you are not good enough to use it. |
| Wolf moon cannon                                             | - It's not good                                              |

## Is the opener I made good?

Short answer: no

Long answer: Depends on a few factors, but most good openers have already been discovered. 

1. If your opener uses a T piece in stack it is already bad.
2. If your opener has a very low success chance it is bad.
3. If your opener does not send at least 9 with the first 2 t pieces its most likely bad. 

![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/567880609653981185/722220173280673814/unknown.png)

## What setups should I learn?

**If you are unable complete a 40 line Tetris-only sprint in under 1:15 minutes (jstris/fast games) or 1:30 minutes Puyo Puyo Tetris (slow game) should focus on practicing that first.**

Once you can do that consistently, learn basic t-spins, [check out garbo's tspin guide (the first part)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FI39WJqTLvA)

More advanced techniques (or "setups") would be t-spin forecasting, floating tspins and donated tspins. (expand later) https://four.lol/mid-game/donation https://four.lol/methods/stmb

## PCO? Perfect Clear Opener? Should I learn perfect clears?

Short answer: no

Long answer: PCO is a popular opener but is a very common noob trap. Lots of people use PCO because it is easy to setup, **not because they can reliably execute it**. 

- In reality PCO is not a good opener because it gives your opponent too much clean garbage, that they will just send back to you. 
- PCO requires you to memorize a lot of solutions to be used effectively. That effort could be better spent learning a better opener instead. 
- Lots of people will use it without knowing all the solutions and fail the opener very often. (How embarrassing)

## Four wide, 4-wide, 4w, 4-w c4w s4w whatever lol

This section is a little complicated due to the state of the community and official games.

To win in any official Tetris game, center 4 wide is the most overpowered strategy by far.

Non-official games have nerfed 4 wide in different ways. 

Generally 4 wide is frowned upon in the community, even though its usually not banned. People often care about being more "honorable" or only care about winning on their own terms. 

That said, any good official guideline player should probably at least learn side 4wide, and probably center 4 wide so that they can counter anyone using 4 wide. 

4 Wide is a big **noob trap** since it is so broken and easy to get wins against inexperienced players. 

Generally people that only use 4w rely on it as a crutch to win the game before mid game. If they encounter someone who can match their 4w and bring them into mid game they don't stand a chance. 

## How to counter center 4 wide?

One of the big problems with this community the lack of motivation to win. People often care about ""honor"" more than winning. As a result, a lot of common advice towards countering 4 wide is just **incorrect**. 

The only true counter to center 4 wide, is center 4 wide, for obvious reasons. 

Other than that there are no **GOOD** counters to center 4 wide. 

Here are a list of common "GOOD" counters **that are actually not that good**: (they will not go even with center 4w consistently. Keep in mind that **c4w works literally 99% of the time**, so a strategy that only works 60% of the time is not good enough):

| Strat                             | Why it is not that good                                      |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Side 4 wide                       | This strategy will only work if you can stack faster than your opponent, which generally is true for side 4w since it is easier to stack. But if your opponent is the same speed as you, it becomes a game of who can reach the top without dying, which C4w always wins, because center well allows you to receive up to 18 lines of garbage without dying. |
| 3 perfect clears                  | This strategy is insanely difficult to pull of fast enough, not to mention most players are not even able get 3 perfect clears consistently. <br />2 perfect clears can work if you are much faster than your opponent, but usually it will just cut their combo short. Also even 2 perfect clears is really hard to pull of every single game. |
| TKI PC / Hachi PC / any t-spin pc | This strategy is more consistent to execute than only perfect clears, but requires you to have the right bag to start out with, which will limit the number of times you even get to use this. The other issue is it only can only send up to 20, which is only barely enough to kill c4w. (Note you will not always get maximum damage due to the fact that you have to take incomplete t-spins to get the perfect clear) |
| Giving up/disconnecting           | Lose the battle, but win the war. :)                         |
| BT cannon/ any loop               | While reliable, unless you are extremely fast, this wont never be enough to kill. |

Most people tend to pick, and even recommend :scream_cat: , **sub-optimal strategies** to counter c4w and then "**out play during the mid game**". And while that is all fine and good, the real issue is all of these strategies will **never put you even, always behind**. (Obviously if the opponent messes up then its different, but if your opponent suicides you win so there's no point to even say this ok?). Also "being better than your opponent" is not a valid strategy.
