# Tetris FAQ

## How to ask a good question

1. Read the FAQ
2. Think about your question before you ask.
   1. Understand that **you do not deserve to have your question answered**. People are taking time out of their day to **help** you. 
   2. Try and phrase your question in a way that makes it easier for the person answering.
      1. Try and be as specific as you can. (This does not mean write a wall of text for no reason)
      2. Actually think about what you are trying to ask.
   3. Try and figure it out yourself first, before you ask. (It's easier to confirm something is right than to explain it from scratch)
      1. If it's gameplay related, try recording and watching yourself.

## I'm a new player, where should I start.

If you are brand new, start by playing a game with **marathon mode**, just try your best to survive.

Once you are familiar with the game and its controls, try and complete a 40 line sprint only using tetrises.  (make sure to rotate in both directions)

Once you can complete a tetris-only sprints consistently, try and lower your tetris-only sprint to around 2-1:30 - 2:00 minutes. 

Once you've done that, you're now ready to play versus. 

Hop into a versus game and good luck!

## How to stack

The best way to learn how to stack is play a lot, and review your own gameplay and the gameplay of people much better than you. 
Experiment and try new things, and try to notice patterns. 

You should have an intuitive understanding of how to stack, most specific guides and tutorials won't help, as it will limit your growth if you try to just "memorize" a list of setups. 

As a general rule of thumb: 

1. Do not make piece dependencies.
2. Plan ahead and make use of your piece previews.

## What controls should I use

Use what ever is comfortable :) 

There is no "best controls"

## What das/arr should I use

In games where you can customize arr and das, arr should be as low as possible (0 or 1). 

To pick a das start around 130ms / 8F (some games use frames which are 16.66 ms) and then keep lowering it until you cannot control it.  

Your das should be probably be below 130 ms unless you have some sort of physical impairment. 

## What is finesse/should I learn it

Finesse is the method of placing a piece in a specific location with as few key presses as possible. (with low ARR)

There is a specific optimal sequence of inputs for every single placement in the game.

People often mean "**Perfect Finesse**" or "2 step finesse", when they refer to finesse. 

Lots of top players do not have "perfect finesse" but will still have a set way of placing pieces. 

Whether you decide you want to use the most optimal set of sequences is up to you. (Still use both rotations though.)

## Should I learn 180 rotations

If you want to. 

Learning to rotate clockwise and counter-clockwise is most important. 180 is extra if you want to. 

It doesn't make that big of a difference. 

# Sprint specific advice

## Sprint time

Here are some rough guidelines to sprint

|              | No delay (Jstris, TETR.IO) | Slow (Puyo Puyo Tetris) |
| ------------ | -------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Pro          | 20 sec                     | 35 sec                  |
| Experienced  | 25 sec                     | 38 sec                  |
| Intermediate | 30 sec                     | 47 sec                  |
| "decent"     | 44 sec                     | 60 sec                  |
| beginner     | 80 sec /1:20 min           | 2:00 min                |
| new          | 3 min+/ DNF                | 3 min+/DNF              |

## **<u>Sprint</u>** openers

You should not rely on <u>**sprint**</u> openers. You should be able to sprint from any starter bag (exception being ZSO openers)

You should be able to figure out your own "<u>**sprint**</u> openers" by playing the game and watching people better than you play. 

(Note: Do not use <u>**versus**</u> openers in sprint)

(Note: <u>**sprint**</u> openers are different from <u>**versus**</u> openers).

## How to get faster (sprint)

Proper practice is key to improvement. Don't feel discouraged when you see people improving faster than you, you have to keep in mind the key factors to improvement. 

1. Time
   1. If you don't actually spend the time to play the game, and review your own gameplay, you will not be able to improve.
2. Efficiency of practice
   1. Some ways of practicing make better use of your time than others. For example, someone who restarts very frequently will get less practice per hour than someone who doesn't. 

Keep in mind that there is a difference between getting a new **personal best** and **improving**. 

## What is good finesse/what should my finesse be in sprint

The finesse value in most games are finesse *faults*. 

If you care about finesse 0, otherwise it doesn't really matter, probably under 15.

## 6-3 vs 9-0 vs 0-9 vs freestyle stacking for sprint

```
6-3
|xxxxxx xxx|
|xxxxxx xxx|
|xxxxxx xxx|
|xxxxxx xxx|

9-0 (right well)
|xxxxxxxxx |
|xxxxxxxxx |
|xxxxxxxxx |
|xxxxxxxxx |

0-9 (left well)
| xxxxxxxxx|
| xxxxxxxxx|
| xxxxxxxxx|
| xxxxxxxxx|

freestyle (some people call it korean stacking, no well) 
|          |
|          |
|          |
|x xxx   xx|
```

| Style     | Pros                                             | Cons                                                         |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 6-3       | More opportunities for better KPP                | More difficult to maintain                                   |
| 9-0       | Easy to maintain                                 | Requires much more thinking to get low KPP                   |
| 0-9       | Don't use this                                   | Has higher KPP than right well (9-0)                         |
| freestyle | Allows for the lowest KPP and most possibilities | Hardest style of stacking to be fast at by far. Clearing lines requires much more mental processing power. Really bad on games with line clear delay |

Any other style of stacking, 5-4, 7-2, 8-1 etc are bad and don't matter. 

# Versus specific advice

## Openers

Learning openers is not as important as learning how to play the mid game. 

An opener is just a transition from an empty board to mid game, don't focus on them too much until you are competent at mid game. You should never rely on openers to win games.

Beginners can opt for a simple tetris as their opener. 

Openers are also dependent on the game. 

The most important opener to learn is TKI. https://four.lol/openers/tki

## Is my opener good

Short answer: no

Long answer: Depends on a few factors, but most good openers have already been discovered. 

1. If your opener uses a T piece in stack it is already bad.
2. If your opener has a very low success chance it is bad.
3. If your opener does not send at least 9 with the first 2 t pieces its most likely bad.
