A popular argument is that hard drop wiki is supposed to be a wiki, a library of information, so whether something is good or bad, is out of the question. While this does seem to make sense, it actually contradicts Blink\'s attitude. A couple months ago a user named Garbo posted a "meme" setup called "DT+". Blink banned Garbo from the wiki because he had "bad intentions", since he knowingly posted a bad setup. If hard drop is a library for all setups, good or bad, why does it matter that the setup was bad? There are plenty of bad setups on the wiki, setups even worse than DT+ on the wiki.
