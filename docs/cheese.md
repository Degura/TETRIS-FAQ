## How do I play cheese? 

Your goal when playing cheese should be to beat 100L with as few blocks as possible. 

## What's a good cheese?

| "Skill"      | Number of blocks |
| ------------ | ---------------- |
| New          | 400+             |
| Beginner     | 300-400          |
| Intermediate | 250-300          |
| Advanced     | under 250        |



## How do I get better at cheese? 

### Beginner tips

For beginners the most important thing to focus on is not blocking your next holes.

**What not to do:**

Another thing that most newer players don't understand is that downstacking is not the same as **Combo** downstacking. Often times players will ruin their downstack to extend the combo by 1 or 2 lines, which will end up harming them more in the long run. (In vs, where combo is rewarded, you will have to make a judgement call. ie, messing up stack to get 11 combo is worth usually).

With these ideas in mind you should be able to get close to 300 blocks, playing slowly of course.

### Intermediate tips

To get under 300 blocks consistently the true secret is just to maximize the use of your previews. Think of where you will place your next 5 pieces before you place your current, and plan ahead as much as possible. 

Like everything in this game, it all is just stacking, so being able to plan ahead properly is the key to success. 



Another misconception is that you have to do crazy spins and skims to have low block cheese. If you actually watch people that have low block cheese, they stack very cleanly and do not do anything fancy:

There is almost always an easier solution.

:::information

Cheese is stacking, and your goal with stacking should always be to stack cleanly. In a good stack the next move should be obvious.
