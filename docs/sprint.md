# Sprint specific advice

## What is a good sprint time? Is my sprint time good?

"Good" is subjective but here are some general guidelines:

|              | No delay (Jstris, TETR.IO) | Slow (Puyo Puyo Tetris) |
| ------------ | -------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Pro          | 20 sec                     | 35 sec                  |
| Experienced  | 25 sec                     | 38 sec                  |
| Intermediate | 30 sec                     | 47 sec                  |
| "decent"     | 44 sec                     | 60 sec                  |
| beginner     | 80 sec /1:20 min           | 2:00 min                |
| new          | 3 min+/ DNF                | 3 min+/DNF              |

## **<u>Sprint</u>** openers

You should not rely on <u>**sprint**</u> openers. You should be able to sprint from any starting bag (exception being "SZ" openers)

You should be able to figure out your own "<u>**sprint**</u> openers" by playing the game and watching people better than you play. Do not rely on sprint openers as it will impact your rate of improvement.

(Note: Do not use <u>**versus**</u> openers in sprint)

(Note: <u>**sprint**</u> openers are different from <u>**versus**</u> openers).

## What is good finesse/what should my finesse be in sprint

:::note
The finesse value in most games are finesse *faults*. 
:::
If you care about finesse aim for 0, otherwise it doesn't really matter, try and keep it under 15~.

## 6-3 vs 9-0 vs 0-9 vs freestyle stacking for sprint

```
6-3
|xxxxxx xxx|
|xxxxxx xxx|
|xxxxxx xxx|
|xxxxxx xxx|

9-0 (right well)
|xxxxxxxxx |
|xxxxxxxxx |
|xxxxxxxxx |
|xxxxxxxxx |

0-9 (left well)
| xxxxxxxxx|
| xxxxxxxxx|
| xxxxxxxxx|
| xxxxxxxxx|

freestyle (some people call it korean stacking, no well) 
|          |
|          |
|          |
|x xxx   xx|
```

| Style     | Pros                                             | Cons                                                         |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 6-3       | More opportunities for better KPP                | More difficult to maintain                                   |
| 9-0       | Easier to maintain                               | Requires much more thinking to get low KPP                   |
| 0-9       | Don't use this                                   | Has higher KPP than right well (9-0)                         |
| freestyle | Allows for the lowest KPP and most possibilities | Hardest style of stacking to be fast at by far. Clearing lines requires much more mental processing power. Really bad on games with line clear delay |

Any other style of stacking,3-6, 5-4, 7-2, 8-1 etc are bad and don't matter. 

## How do I lower KPP? What KPP should I aim for? (Sprint)

Perfect finesse is basically a requirement of low KPP.

A good KPP to aim for in sprint is 3.0 KPP. The best players can get under 2.6 KPP.

Some things that can help lower KPP:

- Hold less. 
- 6-3 stacking can make it easier to get lower KPP. (Note: that this does not mean 6-3 is the *best* way to get low KPP)
- Learn about advanced techniques like das preservation, rotating less, and think A LOT.

Like stacking there isn't a definitive way of getting good, just practice and be analytical.
