Like everything else in this game, t-spinning comes right back to *stacking.* This game is about being able to visualize different placement for your upcoming pieces and then deciding which arrangement is best. The same goes for t-spinning. Instead of just placing a T piece you can first create a hole for it , then be filled in later. 



## Beginner

### What is a t-spin?

In modern guideline games, spinning a T piece to clear lines gives a bonus. 

A t-spin double sends the same amount of lines as a Tetris (4, 5 with b2b)

To qualify as T-spin 3 of the 4 red/green blocks need to be filled in, 2 of which need to be green to count as a full t-spin. If 3/4 are filled but not 2 green, then it is a t-spin mini. (I didn't make this up)

There is also a special case where a mini can be upgraded to a full t-spin when the last kick is used (basically is why stsd is not a mini)

### The T shape

The most fundamental part of learning how to t-spin is being able to spot the "T" shape in your stack.

Notice the T shape. 

The next step is creating an overhang for the T, to satisfy the conditions for a t-spin.

### Opportunistic T-spinning

As a beginner, you will not have built up the mental library to do many advanced setups, so just focus on finding premade "T" shapes in your stack.

### Building overhangs

You won't always be given the T shapes in game, so it is important to learn how to build your own. The more you build the less you will have to rely on chance.

Let's look at an example:

Do you see the T shape? Well, its not quite a full T, but we can make it one.

So now instead of relying on a single shape (a complete T), we can look for many more opportunities.

Take a look at all 7 pieces in the game, and see what kind of overhangs you can build. 

### Quiz

## Intermediate

### Singleplayer vs multiplayer

One of the major issues a lot of people learning the game face is that they do not understand the difference between singleplayer modes, like sprint and ultra, and vs mode. 

The main difference between singleplayer and multiplayer is you have an opponent. A good opponent will punish you for making bad decisions, where as in singleplayer, the worst case scenario is that you restart.

This means that a lot of bad decisions may work out in singleplayer, but would cost you the game in multiplayer.

This applies to t-spins because you should never compromise your stack when making T-spins. All too often beginners play a mode called "20tsd" where they basically trash their board in attempts to get as many t-spins as possible. While some consider this a useful exercise for improving "T-spin vision", nearly everything they do is impractical for versus. It is possible to practice "20tsd" properly but, unless you are an expert, you will likely just be wasting your time, or even worse, forming bad habits.

### Basic builds

Once you are able to spot t-shapes, it is time to take it one step further.

Learning to build the T shape itself will allow you to get many more t-spins.

Do you see how you can make a T shape here?

Like before, take a look at all 7 pieces and see how you can apply this concept to them.

### TST and STSD

Just seeing these setups are useful, but you'll probably never have to use these opportunistically.

### Thinking more steps ahead

Your next goal will be to try and think one more step ahead. Once you master this you will be able to reliably find t spin doubles in game.

### Forecast/foresight?/prophecy

This technique has a couple of different names, but the main idea is "uncovering" t-spins.

![](https://i.imgur.com/ZfdGhbT.png)

Do you see the T shape? Try clearing the Tetris first.

### Height difference 

To do a basic T-spin, both sides of your stack need to be the same height.

Good:

Bad:

Notice how there is no easy way to form a T shape on the second image. This board is in a "dead" state.

Paying attention to how certain pieces effects the height of your stack will be key in getting many t-spin opportunities.

### Skimming

Note: this should not be your preferred method. Only use this as a fix, if you find yourself needing this a lot, it might be time to reevaluate your stacking decisions.

Skimming is similar in concept to forecasting except it is usually used to fix bad stack height difference. Unlike forecasting which is usually done with a Tetris, skimming is never done with a Tetris, so it is much less efficient.

Use L to skim.

## Advanced

### Floating T-Spins / Donation

Now you've mastered spotting the T, it is time to spot the entire row.

These advanced techniques will allow you to create T-spins using less pieces, which can make T-spins possible where they wouldn't normally be.

#### Donations

A donation is purposefully covering your well temporarily (lol) to fill in the necessary blocks to create a T-spin

Basic example (well is open after the t-spin):

![](https://i.imgur.com/ewQ27pO.png)

Bad example (after the t-spin is cleared you have not uncovered the well): 

![](https://i.imgur.com/jW5thtH.png)

#### Floating T-spins

A floating T-spin is purposefully creating a temporary floating section to fill in the blocks necessary to create a T-spin

Basic example (no floating stuff leftover)

![](https://i.imgur.com/Eq6hZUN.png)

Bad example: (You will have a floating thing left over)

![](https://i.imgur.com/QrKle0g.png)

#### How to get better at them

Focus on the rows and try and visualize how your upcoming pieces fit into that row. Be mindful of the columns underneath that row as well, so you don't cover them.



### Dead boards

"Dead" board, or "dead" state, is a term I like to use to describe fields that have no easy T-spin opportunities.
