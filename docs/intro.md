## How to ask a good question

1. Read the FAQ first
2. Try to think about your question before you ask it.
   1. Understand that people are taking time out of **their day** to **help you**. 
   2. Try and phrase your question in a way that makes it **easier for the person answering**.
      1. Try and **be as specific** as you can. (This does not mean write as much as you can).
      2. **Be clear**. It only slows down the process if people have to repeatedly ask for more detail or clarification. You don't want to waste the time of people trying to help you
      3. **Think** about what you are trying to ask for a bit, that way you can formulate a better question.
   3. Try and figure it out yourself, before asking.
      1. The best way to learn something is figuring it out yourself.
      2. It's easier to confirm something is right than to explain it from scratch.
      3. If it's gameplay related, try recording and watching yourself. 
      4. check FAQ

## How to answer questions

1. The goal here is to **minimize misinformation**
   1. Make sure you **know** what you are **qualified** to talk about.
   2. Make sure you are **able to explain** **what** you are saying and **why**, otherwise you might not have a complete understanding of it. 
   3. Know what you *don't know*, if you don't know what you don't know, you're more likely to mislead people.
   4. Think before you answer, if you don't know the answer, don't say anything. It's ok to be wrong, but not to mislead others.
